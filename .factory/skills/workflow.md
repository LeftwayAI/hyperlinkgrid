# AI Workflow Guide

## Roles
*   **Overseer (You)**: Manages high-level specs, architecture, and "RINSED" status.
*   **Agents (Workers)**: Implement specific tasks based on skills.

## Rules
1.  **Read First**: Always read `agents.md` and relevant `.factory/skills` before starting.
2.  **Spec Mode**: Use spec mode for major architectural changes.
3.  **Documentation**: Update `agents.md` when moving items from "NEXT" to "RIGHT NOW" or "completed".
4.  **Testing**: Verify changes locally before marking as done.

## Branching
*   **Main**: Production/Staging code.
*   **Feature Branches**: Use for large features, but for this hackathon, direct commits to main are acceptable if tested.
